## 💡 Key Business Insights
### 1. Profit at Risk Analysis
* Identified **$659.82K in losses** originating from products performing below the strategic 15% margin threshold.

### 2. Discount Correlation (Scatter Plot)
* Discovered a direct correlation between **high discounting (>20%)** and **negative profit** in the Furniture category.
* Visualized outlier products that are "Profit Villains" using scatter plot trend lines.

### 3. Strategy Simulator
* Built a **Target Margin Slider** that allows managers to simulate the impact of different profit floors on the bottom line.
* Automated **Red-Flag Highlighting** in the product table for immediate executive action.
