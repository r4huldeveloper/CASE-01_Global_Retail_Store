📊 Global Ecommerce Store Analysis & Profit Recovery
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying and mitigating Profit Leakage within a Global Ecommerce store. By analyzing sales data, I developed a diagnostic dashboard to pinpoint high-discount products and regions underperforming against strategic profit targets.

The primary goal was to simulate a 15% Target Margin Floor to visualize "Profit at Risk" and provide actionable insights for executive decision-making.

🚀 Key Features & Insights
1. Profit Recovery Diagnostic (Tab 2)
Profit At Risk: Identified approximately -$660K in direct losses from products performing below the 15% margin threshold.

Dynamic Simulations: Integrated a Target Margin Floor parameter to allow stakeholders to simulate different policy impacts.

Leakage Correlation: Used Scatter Plot analysis to visualize how high discounting directly impacts profitability across different categories.

Conditional Highlighting: Automated row highlighting for products failing to meet strategic margin targets.

2. Loss Driving Identification
Pinpointed the Furniture category as a primary source of leakage with an average margin significantly below Technology and Office Supplies.

Listed Top 5 Loss-Driving Products to prioritize inventory and pricing reviews.

📈 Business Impact
Provided a clear roadmap to recover leaked profit by identifying specific products for pricing adjustments.

Enabled real-time "What-If" analysis for regional managers to set realistic profit floors.

Reduced the time-to-insight for identifying underperforming stock units (SKUs).
